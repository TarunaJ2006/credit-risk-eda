# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this exploratory analysis repository.

Guidelines:

- Fork the repository and create a feature branch for your change: `git checkout -b feature/your-change`.
- Make small, focused commits with clear messages.
- If you add code (scripts or modules), include or update tests where appropriate.
- Update `README.md` when you change any user-facing instructions, file paths or outputs.
- Open a pull request describing the change and why it is needed. Include screenshots or sample outputs if you changed visualizations.

Code style and licensing:

- Keep code and notebooks well-documented. Avoid committing large raw data files — add them to `.gitignore` and provide instructions to download or place them in the `data/` directory.
- All contributions will be licensed under the repository license (see `LICENSE.md`).

Thank you — your improvements help make the analysis reproducible and useful to others.
